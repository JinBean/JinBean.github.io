									<h3 class="major">About</h3>
									<p>As an extension to our <a href="coinwatch">cryptocurrency research paper</a>, we applied for extensions to exisiting CVEs, which were accepted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the MITRE Corporation.</p>
									<p>Currently, we have a total of 4 approved CVE extensions.</p>
									<h3 class="major"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17144">CVE-2018-17144</a></h3>
									<p>Bitcoin Core 0.14.x before 0.14.3, 0.15.x before 0.15.2, and 0.16.x before 0.16.3 allow a remote denial of service (application crash) exploitable by miners via duplicate input. Attackers can also double spend Bitcoin transactions, causing an artificial inflation of Bitcoin.</p>
									<p>At the time of our discovery (26/3/2019), we found 6 different cryptocurrencies that also contained this vulnerability including MinexCoin, MktCoin, and PlatinCoin.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7167">CVE-2019-7167</a></h3>
									<p>Zcash, before the Sapling network upgrade (2018-10-28), had a counterfeiting vulnerability. A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement, produced certain bypass elements. 
										Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the proof system. 
										This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction.</p>
									<p>At the time of our discovery (27/5/2019), we found 1 other cryptocurrency that also contained this vulnerability - Hush.</p>

									<h3 class="major"><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10724">CVE-2016-10724</a> / <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10725">CVE-2016-10725</a></h3>
									<p>These two vulnerabilites are closely related and hence are grouped in the same section.</p>
									<p>A remote network alert system originating from Bitcoin allows the denial of service (memory exhaustion) if an attacker can sign a message with a certain private key that had been known by unintended actors. Due to an infinitely sized map, 
										an attacker can send a large number of alerts (or very large alerts, or both) to a node, causing the node to run out of memory and crash. The alert system in itself also creates a centralized source in the cryptocurrency. 
										Bitcoin has since deprecated the alert system entirely.</p>
									<p>At the time of our discovery (14/6/2019), we found 377 other cryptocurrencies that also contained this vulnerability including Zcash, Bitcoin Private, and Dogecoin.</p>
