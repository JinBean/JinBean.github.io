									<h3 class="major">About</h3>
									<p>As part of a core module, we were assigned Accenture as our client. They wanted a modern support ticketing system that allows their ACNAPI API consumers to submit
										support requests, creating a ticket in the system for administrators to respond to. The project was built on Flask, MySQL and Accenture's ACNAPI.
									</p>
									<p> Out of 18 different teams that worked on this project, we were chosen to be the best
									ticketing system project by the Accenture team. Out of 37 total projects in the whole course (involving different clients and projects), we were selected to be in the top 3.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Features</h3>
									<p>The features that we built for this system included a dashboard for both users and administrators. Users can submit support requests of different categories and can upload relevant documents like screenshots,
										and are emailed their ticket request along with a unique ID. Accenture administrators can then follow up using an in-built real time chat. The chat history is recorded and can be viewed by both user and administrator in the
										case of any further disputes. The administrator dashboard consisted of a ticket management system, where they are allowed to sort, resolve, and archive different tickets.
