									<h3 class="major">About Saleswhale</h3>
									<p>Saleswhale is a Singapore based startup that was a part of the 2016 Y Combinator. Its AI sales assistant engages and qualifies marketing-generated leads at scale, through two-way intelligent email conversations, before handing over qualified leads to sales reps.</p>

									<h3 class="major">My Internship</h3>
									<p>I interned as part of the backend engineering team and helped develop its main product on a Ruby on Rails stack. I helped build multiple new features, and wrote various RESTful API endpoints for both internal and external facing tools.</p>
									<p> I also worked partially on some frontend development involving emberJS and nodeJS to implement new components and to fix bugs that directly affected customers.</p>

									<h3 class="major">My Takeaways</h3>
									<p>It was initially difficult to keep up with the fast paced working style of a budding startup, especially since I had never worked with Ruby on Rails before that.
										However, the emphasis on a culture of constant learning and radical candor allowed me to grow quickly not only as a developer, but also as a person. Despite lacking any experience, the interns were
										trusted with working on customer facing products. We worked on various test environments, sat in on sprint meetings and design plannings, had daily/weekly standups, and learnt to work on user story mappings.
										Constant code reviews allowed me to develop a habit of test driven development, a skill which follows me through every project I would do from then on.
										I was treated not as an intern, but as a member of the Saleswhale family from the very first day. I can honestly say that I enjoyed every moment of working in Saleswhale.
